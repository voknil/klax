// scope.js — the view scope: which subset of sessions this browser window shows.
//
// The scope lives in the URL fragment, so a scope is just a bookmarkable address and a second window
// is a plain browser tab — no new UI, no server routing. One namespace holds three things, told
// apart by shape (this parse rule is the whole contract):
//
//   #1783809783        all digits  → a session id, root scope
//   #work              has neither → a user group
//   #is:unread         has a colon → a computed view (parsed here, not implemented yet)
//   #work/1783809783   two segments: scope + the tab active inside it
//
// Everything scope-shaped is derived HERE and nowhere else: membership, the per-scope "last viewed
// tab" key, the hash writer, the window title prefix and the chip. Groups themselves are never stored
// by this module — they ride on the sessions.

// SCOPE_GLYPH is our own ≡, drawn so it behaves like a LOWERCASE LETTER of the text beside it: it

// places differently — and one drawn constant serves both the chip and the menu bullets, so they
// cannot drift apart.
//
// The viewBox is a HALF-PIXEL grid: 16 units render as 8 CSS px, so one unit = 0.5px and the whole
// drawing stays integer while positions finer than a pixel remain expressible. Bars are 2 units
// (1px), gaps 4 units (2px), the band is 14 units (7px), and it sits one unit (0.5px) above the
// element's bottom edge — which is the baseline. That half step is the middle between the two whole
// pixels we tried, reached by scaling the grid instead of writing a fractional offset in CSS.
//
// Everything is a fixed fraction of the element's box, so under zoom the mark scales by exactly the
// zoom factor. The first version was sized in `ex` and drifted against the text between zoom levels:
// `ex` is a font metric the engine resolves (and rounds) per zoom, and the text baseline is snapped
// to whole device pixels by hinting while an SVG box edge is not — so at 100% a 1.2px bar smeared
// across two pixel rows, while at 300% the same absolute error was three times smaller and the true
// geometry showed through. No font metric is involved here any more.
